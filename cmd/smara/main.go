// Side-effect imports register cloud-memory providers with the
// internal/memory/cloud registry at process start, so by the time
// rootCmd parses flags `cloud.Get("turso")` resolves successfully
// without the CLI layer having to know each provider's package path.
//
// Per task 8.6 of the cloud-memory spec, the Turso provider is the
// default backend; additional providers (Supabase, D1, ...) plug in
// here as their own blank imports without further wiring.
